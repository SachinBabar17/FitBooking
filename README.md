# FitBooking

FitBooker is a lightweight and efficient booking API designed for fitness studios to manage class schedules and client reservations seamlessly. Built using FastAPI, the application enables clients to view available classes such as Yoga, Zumba, and HIIT, and reserve spots in real-time.

The system handles class availability, prevents overbooking, supports time zone-aware scheduling (created in IST), and provides booking lookup by email â€” all while ensuring input validation and robust error handling.
